### Recommended System Requirements to run this repo:
CPU: Intel Skylake (16 vCPU)
RAM: 104 GB
GPU: Nvidia Tesla P100

### Instructions for running
The two main notebooks that need to be run to train the spectrum of models (7 models in total, with PeeleNet at one end of the spectrum and DenseNet-41 on the other) on CIFAR10 and ImageNet respectively are:
1. Run_this_cifar10
2. Run_this_imagenet

*Note: Whenever we mention ImageNet in this repo, we are referring to the subset of ImageNet (containing 198 classes with almost 500 images per class) that was downloaded using https://github.com/mf1024/ImageNet-Datasets-Downloader*
